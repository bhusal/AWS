Amazon Simple Storage is an object storage, which provides users to almost unlimited storage space. N Number of storage objects into S3 Bucket, however after storing the lot of objects we would like to know how much of storage we have utilized. In this article i will show you how to get S3 Bucket Size / Usage using simple 10 ways.

Method1: S3 Bucket Size
Use this article to aws configure to authenticate against AWS resources, required AWS CLI configuration first.

aws s3 ls s3://BUCKETNAME --recursive | grep -v -E "(Bucket: |Prefix: |LastWriteTime|^$|--)" | awk 'BEGIN {total=0}{total+=$3}END{print total/1024/1024/1024" GB"}'
above one liner will recursively list all the objects in S3 storage and capture all the objects size and sum value will be displayed in GB’s.

Method2: S3 Bucket Usage
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket BUCKETNAME --output json --query "[sum(Versions[].Size)]"
using s3api call list all the S3 objects and get sum value in bytes. Convert bytes value to KB or MB or GB or TB divided by 1024

Method3
aws s3 ls s3://BUCKET --recursive --human-readable --summarize
it will list all objects in s3 bucket and in the end of output, it will display number of objects and size

Total Objects: 81734
Total Size: 493.7 GiB

Test access with supplied credentials? [Y/n] y
Please wait, attempting to list all buckets...
Success. Your access key and secret key worked fine :-)

Save settings? [y/N] y
Configuration saved to '/home/user/.s3cfg'
run s3cmd to get the output. It will display in size bytes

$ s3cmd du
$ s3cmd du s3://NAME
